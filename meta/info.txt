question:
Fibonacci Series

statement:
Write a function called function which takes one argument x which is a integer. The function should calculate xth fibonacci number and return the result.
Fibonacci Series is create by adding previous two numbers of the series and it starts from 0, 1.
Fibonacci Series:  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...


solution:
def function(x):
    a = 0
    b = 1
    
    if x == 1:
        return a
    elif x == 2:
        return b

    for i in range(x-2):
        a, b = b, a+b

    return b

test case:
def test_case(func):
  assert func(1) == 0
  assert func(2) == 1
  assert func(13) == 144
